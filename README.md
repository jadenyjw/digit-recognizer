# Waveform Visualizer - CSCB58 Final Project

This project is an FPGA application on the Altera DE2 115 board that visualizes sound input from a microphone input.
It outputs the sound waves it receives onto a monitor. 
The user is also able to listen to the input from a speaker, and is also able to transform that input using the onboard switches.


## Usage

Connect a microphone to the microphone jack and connect a speaker to the speaker jack. Connect a monitor to the VGA port.
