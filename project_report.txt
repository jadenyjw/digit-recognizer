Project Plan
--------

Project Title: Digit Recognizer

Provide a one paragraph description of your project:

Digit Recognizer will have a neural network implemented using Verilog, with the task of recognizing sketched digits sent through
the USB Blaster Cable from the computer. Depending on the digit drawn, the FPGA board will output a specific digit onto the 
HEX Display. 

Tasks to implement:

- Train a neural network for the MNIST data.
	- Design a simple enough architecture so that the board can support it.
	- Could possibly use a pretrained network.
	
- Figure out a way to convert the weights of the network into Verilog code.
	
- Figure out how to implement data transfer from the computer to the board.
	- Define a common protocol between the board and the computer.
	- Readings: JTAG UART

What is your plan for the first week?

Task Distribution:

Figure out a common protocol between the board and the computer.
Subteam A: Figure out how to implement JTAG UART with the board. Implement a few demo cases. 
Subteam B: Figure out how to generate Verilog code to represent the network.

What is your plan for the second week?

Both teams will try to combine the results of the previous week's together.

What is your plan for the third week?

Run testing if done, otherwise, attempt to complete previous week's material.

What is your backup plan if things donâ€™t work out as planned?

Depending on what went wrong:

If the FPGA part went wrong: No clue what to do.
If the Data Transfer part went wrong: Hardcode image "values" and test on that.

Weekly Reports
--------------
<In this space, provide a report each week of what worked and what didn't, and what (if any) changes were made to your proposal)>


[This is an example of a report where things didn't go so well.]
Week 1:
	We added and tested the sensors and the main FSM.
	The distance sensor we had intended to use didn't work as expected (wasn't precise enough at further distances, only seems to work accurately within 5-10cm), so instead we've decided to change the project to use a light sensor instead.
	Had trouble getting the FSM to work (kept getting stuck in state 101, took longer to debug than expected), so we may not be able to add the high score feature. We have updated that in the project description as an optional feature.
